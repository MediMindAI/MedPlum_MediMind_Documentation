## Instructions

Launch the **frontend-designer** agent to upgrade this page's UI.

**MANDATORY: Read `THEME_COLORS.md` first** - This is the authoritative source for all EMR theme colors, gradients, and design tokens.

**Input provided:** The user has specified either:
- A screenshot path (e.g., `screenshots/current-page.png`)
- A page route (e.g., `/emr/patient-history`)
- A description of what to upgrade

**Agent capabilities:**
1. Takes BEFORE screenshots using Playwright
2. Analyzes all visual issues (colors, typography, components, responsiveness)
3. Creates a detailed plan in `tasks/ui-upgrade-todo.md`
4. IMPLEMENTS all code changes following MediMind design system
5. Takes AFTER screenshots to verify improvements
6. Iterates until the page is production-ready and beautiful

**The frontend-designer agent will:**
- Replace all hardcoded colors with theme variables
- Ensure all buttons use the primary gradient
- Convert modals to EMRModal
- Fix mobile responsiveness (44px tap targets, 16px min font)
- Add loading skeletons and empty states
- Apply proper transitions, shadows, and polish

Pass the user's input to the frontend-designer agent and let it execute the full workflow.
